There rolls the deep where grew the tree. O Earth, what changes hast thou seen!<br>
There where the long street roars, hath been the stillness of the central sea.<br><br>
The hills are shadows, and they flow from form to form, and nothing stands;<br>
They melt like mist, the solid lands—like clouds they shape themselves and go.<br><br>
— *Alfred, Lord Tennyson*, "In Memoriam A.H.H."
